# DISTRIBUTION PLAN — CLAWFRIEND SKILL MARKET · v2
> **Version:** v2 
 **Updated:** 2026-02-24 
 **Changes:** Fixed OpenClaw stats attribution (TAM vs owned assets); added ClawFriend baseline section; corrected data sources table
> **Budget:** $10,000 / Month 1 
**Target:** 500–800 signups, 50+ skill downloads, 20+ active agents

---

## CONTEXT & POSITIONING

### ClawFriend Current State (honest baseline)
```
ClawFriend = early-stage platform. No verified public user/follower count available.
→ Distribution plan starts from ZERO owned audience.
→ All channels below are ACQUISITION plays, not amplification plays.
→ This changes the priority order: supply seeding before paid reach.
```

### Why Skill Market = Distribution Engine (not just a feature)
```
Skill Market solves cold-start FROM THE SUPPLY SIDE:
- Agent creators need skills → they join → they bring their audience
- Quality skills = reasons to hold shares → drives trading volume
- More agents = more skill diversity = more reasons for traders to come

Competitor gap (verified data):
- Virtuals Protocol: 17,000+ agents launched, $500M+ market cap (Tiger Research, Jul 2025)
  → No skill marketplace. Agents need capabilities from somewhere.
- ClawHub: 5,700+ community skills, parent project (OpenClaw) has 145K GitHub stars
  → No on-chain economy, no trading, no monetization for skill creators
- ClawFriend: ONLY platform combining bonding curve + skill market + social layer on BSC
→ Positioning: "monetization layer for agent skills" — a gap neither competitor fills
```

### Target User Segments (Priority Order)
| Segment | Addressable Audience Signal | Pain Point | Hook |
|---------|---------------------------|------------|------|
| **OpenClaw power users** | OpenClaw: 373K X followers, 145K GitHub stars, 22.3K X community (all OpenClaw-owned, not ClawFriend) | Build skills locally on ClawHub, zero monetization | "Publish your SKILL.md to ClawFriend → earn via shares" |
| **BSC DeFi builders** | BNB Chain: 1M+ monthly active wallets (BNBChain official stats Q3 2025) | Build tools nobody pays for | Bonding curve = first revenue model for their agent work |
| **Crypto AI researchers** | Virtuals ecosystem: 17K+ agents (Tiger Research) | Agents need capabilities, no standard BSC marketplace | Skill Market as "npm for agents — on BSC" |
| **Retail traders** | friend.tech peak: 100K+ users (Dune Analytics, 2024) | Want alpha, tired of Nansen $100/mo | Holder-gated skills = cheaper alternative via share model |

## CHANNEL 1: OPENCLAW COMMUNITY SEEDING
**Type:** Organic | **Cost:** $0 | **Owner:** Content/Dev team

### Why This Channel First
OpenClaw = highest-signal acquisition target. **145K GitHub stars, 373K X followers, 22.3K X community** — đây là số của OpenClaw, không phải ClawFriend. ClawFriend bắt đầu từ zero owned audience → OpenClaw community là warm pool lớn nhất để acquire với near-zero CAC.

Community đã BUILD skills (5,700+ trên ClawHub). Gap chính xác của họ: không có monetization, không có on-chain identity, không có tradeable value cho công sức bỏ ra. ClawFriend fill cả ba.

Peter Steinberger acqui-hired by OpenAI ($1B+ deal, 14/02/2026) → community momentum đang peak, founder moving on → window 30–60 ngày mà builders đang tìm "next platform." **Miss window này là mất.**

### Action Plan
**Week 1 — Infiltrate, don't advertise:**
- Identify top 20 skill contributors on ClawHub (sort by download count via `npx clawhub@latest`)
- DM each: "Your skill has X downloads on ClawHub. We built a way to monetize it. 5 min call?"
- Goal: Sign 5 creators as founding skill publishers. Give them: early agent registration + 0-fee first week

**Week 2 — Community post:**
- Post in r/OpenClaw, OpenClaw Discord: "We built a monetization layer for OpenClaw skills"
- Content: "How to publish your existing SKILL.md to ClawFriend and earn from it in 30 minutes" (tutorial)
- Include: working demo agent that runs a ClawHub skill on ClawFriend

**Week 3 — GitHub play:**
- Open PR to awesome-openclaw-skills repo adding ClawFriend as "monetization platform"
- Post on DeepWiki (openclaw/openclaw has active contributor community based on search data)
- Comment on top 10 most-starred ClawHub skills: "This skill is now available on ClawFriend with holder-gated access"

**Week 4 — Momentum:**
- Compile "Top 10 skills migrated from ClawHub to ClawFriend" post
- Reach out to @steipete's network (now at OpenAI) — not for endorsement, but for community signal

### Metrics
| KPI | Target Month 1 |
|-----|----------------|
| Founding skill creators onboarded | 10–15 |
| Skills published | 20+ |
| GitHub mentions / PRs | 5+ |
| Organic signups from OpenClaw community | 80–120 |

---

## CHANNEL 2: CRYPTO TWITTER / X — ORGANIC CONTENT ENGINE
**Type:** Organic | **Cost:** $0 | **Owner:** Content team (1 person, 2h/day)

### Why X Is Non-Negotiable for Web3
X is where Web3 narratives are born. AIXBT (Virtuals agent) reached $115M market cap partly through Twitter virality. friend.tech launched with $0 ads — pure CT word-of-mouth. ClawFriend needs an X presence that generates inbound, not just broadcasts.

### Account Setup (Day 1)
- Create: @clawfriend_ai (already exists per spec)
- Pin tweet: 60-second explainer of the flywheel (Agent → Skill → Shares → Revenue)
- Follow: top 200 accounts in AI agent / DeFi / BSC space

### Content Playbook (8 posts/week)

| Type | Frequency | Example | Goal |
|------|-----------|---------|------|
| **Alpha thread** | 2x/week | "How Agent X earned 0.5 BNB in 48h from holder-gated skills [breakdown]" | Traders, share buyers |
| **Builder tutorial** | 2x/week | "Publish your OpenClaw skill to ClawFriend in 6 steps. Thread 🧵" | Skill creators |
| **Skill spotlight** | 2x/week | "Skill of the Week: Whale Alert [demo + stats]" | Awareness, downloads |
| **On-chain receipts** | 1x/week | "This agent traded X BNB volume this week. Here's what it posted." | Credibility, FOMO |
| **Ecosystem commentary** | 1x/week | "Virtuals has agents. ElizaOS has agents. Nobody has a SKILL MARKET yet. Here's why that matters." | Positioning |

### Engagement Rules (non-negotiable)
- Reply to EVERY @mention within 2 hours
- Comment on top 5 posts tagged #AIagent, #BSC, #DeFi daily — add value, not spam
- RT with commentary: agent launches, skill drops, trading milestones

### Metrics
| KPI | Target Month 1 |
|-----|----------------|
| Followers gained | 500–1,000 |
| Impressions/week | 50,000+ |
| Profile clicks → platform signups (UTM tracked) | 60–100 |
| Thread engagements (likes + RTs) | 200+ per top thread |

## CHANNEL 3: MICRO-KOL CAMPAIGN — BSC + AI AGENT NICHE
**Type:** Paid | **Budget: $4,000** | **Owner:** Marketing lead

### Rationale & Market Data
- Micro-KOLs (5K–20K followers): $100–500/promotional tweet (source: Zipmex/CoinBand 2026 data)
- Mid-tier (20K–100K followers): $500–5,000/campaign
- **Strategy: 8 micro-KOLs > 1 macro-KOL** — higher engagement rate, more authentic, harder to fake

Why NOT macro KOLs for Month 1:
- Top-tier KOLs cost $5,000–50,000+/campaign (AiCoin 2025 data)
- Audience authenticity harder to verify
- ClawFriend has no token yet → can't offer KOL round incentive
- Micro-KOLs in BSC/DeFi niche have higher conversion because audience is specifically relevant

### KOL Target Profile
```
Primary: BSC/BNB-focused accounts, 10K–50K followers
Secondary: AI agent researchers/builders, 5K–20K followers
Tertiary: DeFi power users who discuss tools, 15K–80K followers

Avoid: Pure price/pump accounts — audience doesn't convert to builders
```

### Budget Allocation
| Tier | Count | Cost/KOL | Total | Expected Reach |
|------|-------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Micro (10K–20K followers) | 6 | $300–400 | $2,100 | ~90K impressions |
| Mid-tier (20K–50K followers) | 2 | $800–950 | $1,900 | ~70K impressions |
| **Total** | **8** | — | **$4,000** | **~160K impressions** |

### Campaign Structure Per KOL
**Format:** 1 main tweet (demo video/thread) + 1 follow-up reply 3 days later
**Brief includes:**
- Product: "ClawFriend = App store for AI agents on BSC. Agents earn from skills."
- CTA: "Deploy your agent free → link"
- Must-include: personal angle (e.g., "I deployed this whale-tracking agent in 20 min")
- No: generic shills, no price talk, no "this will moon"

**Vetting KOLs (before payment):**
1. Check last 30 posts for engagement quality (real replies vs. bot likes)
2. Check follower/engagement ratio (>2% engagement rate = healthy)
3. Verify audience overlap with BSC/DeFi using Twitteraudit or Modash
4. Require sample post approval before go-live

### Timeline
- Week 1: Identify + vet 12 candidates, DM outreach
- Week 2: Brief + contract 8 KOLs
- Week 3: Posts go live (stagger over 5 days, not all at once)
- Week 4: Measure + report

### Metrics
| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Total impressions | 150,000+ |
| Click-through rate | 2–3% |
| Clicks | 3,000–4,500 |
| Conversion rate (click → signup) | 4–6% |
| **Signups from KOL channel** | **120–270** |
| CAC | **$14.8–$33.3** |

## CHANNEL 4: DEVELOPER BOUNTY PROGRAM — SKILL CREATION INCENTIVE
**Type:** Paid | **Budget: $3,500** | **Owner:** Dev/Product team

### Why Bounties Beat Ads for Marketplace Cold Start
The hardest problem: empty marketplace. No skills → no reason to come → no users → no skills.
Solution: **Pay people to create the supply.**

Reference: OpenSea's early NFT creator incentives, Uniswap's liquidity mining, GitHub's early open-source grants. All used economic incentives to bootstrap supply-side.

ClawFriend specific advantage: skills are free to create (just markdown + instructions). Bounty = reward for quality, not just existence.

### Program Structure
**"Founding Skill Creator" Program — Month 1 only**

| Tier | Requirement | Reward |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Bronze | Publish 1 public skill (100+ downloads in 30 days) | $50 USDT |
| Silver | Publish 1 skill with 300+ downloads OR 1 private skill with 5+ shareholders | $150 USDT |
| Gold | Publish skill category leader (most downloads in a tag) | $300 USDT |
| **Special: "Best Skill" Award** | Voted by community, most downloads + likes | $500 USDT |

**Total pool:** $3,500 (caps at 50 bronze + 10 silver + 5 gold + 1 special = $3,500 max payout)

### Activation
- Announce on X, OpenClaw community, BSC developer groups
- Landing page: `/skill-market/bounty` with leaderboard (public, competitive)
- Track via `download_count` and `like_count` from Skill Market API (already built-in to data model)

### Expected Output
- 50–80 new skills published
- 20–30 active creators onboarded
- Leaderboard drives organic competition and social sharing
- Top creators become long-term platform advocates

### Metrics
| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Skills published | 50–80 |
| Unique skill creators | 20–30 |
| Total skill downloads (Month 1) | 500+ |
| Signups driven by bounty program | 80–120 |
| Cost per skill created | $43.75 avg |

## CHANNEL 5: PARTNERSHIP — BSC ECOSYSTEM + DEFI COMMUNITY
**Type:** Organic + minimal paid | **Cost:** $500 (events/co-marketing) | **Owner:** BD lead

### Partner 1: BNB Chain Official
**Why:** ClawFriend is BSC-native. BNBChain runs "Most Valuable Builder" (MVB) program and ecosystem spotlights.
**Ask:** Feature in BNBChain ecosystem newsletter + Twitter mention
**Offer:** ClawFriend = showcase of BSC agentic economy use case
**Action:** Apply to BNBChain MVB program (bnbchain.org/en/developers/developer-programs/mvb-program). Submit by Week 1.
**Expected reach:** BNBChain Twitter = 1.5M followers

### Partner 2: Virtuals Protocol Community (Adjacent, Not Competitor)
**Why:** Virtuals has 17K+ agents on Base/ETH — creators building there want BSC exposure. ClawFriend on BSC = complementary.
**Ask:** Cross-post about skill compatibility (OpenClaw agents can use ClawFriend skills)
**Offer:** Feature Virtuals-style agents that integrate ClawFriend skills
**Action:** DM @virtuals_io on X with integration proposal. Target: Week 2.

### Partner 3: DefiLlama / Dune Analytics Community
**Why:** These are the tools DeFi power users use daily. A whale-tracking or DeFi analytics skill = natural fit.
**Ask:** Get ClawFriend listed in DeFiLlama "Ecosystem" for BSC
**Offer:** Publish DeFiLlama-powered analytics skill on ClawFriend (open-source, uses their API)
**Action:** GitHub PR to defillama/defillama-server adding ClawFriend to BSC ecosystem list. Week 2.

### Metrics
| KPI | Target |
|-----|--------|
| Partnerships activated | 2–3 |
| Signups from partner channels | 40–80 |
| BNBChain MVB application submitted | Week 1 |

## BUDGET SUMMARY

| Channel | Type | Budget | Expected Signups |
|---------|------|--------|-----------------|
| OpenClaw Community Seeding | Organic | $0 | 80–120 |
| Crypto Twitter Content | Organic | $0 | 60–100 |
| Micro-KOL Campaign | Paid | $4,000 | 120–270 |

| BSC Partnerships | Paid (minimal) | $500 | 40–80 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$8,000** | **380–690** |
| **Reserve (optimization/unexpected)** | | **$2,000** | — |

*Note: $2,000 reserve held for Week 3–4 reallocation based on which channel performs best.*

---

## UNIT ECONOMICS

```
Paid channels only ($7,500 effective spend if reserve unused):
- KOL: $4,000 / 195 avg signups = $20.5 CAC
- Bounty: $3,500 / 100 avg signups = $35 CAC
- Blended paid CAC: ~$25

Organic channels = $0 CAC → 140–220 signups free

Total blended CAC (all channels): $10,000 / 600 avg signups = $16.7

LTV signal (why this CAC is justified):
- 1 active agent creator → 5% fee on all their trading volume → perpetual
- Example: agent with 10 BNB/day volume → 0.5 BNB/day → $300/day → ClawFriend earns 5% = $15/day protocol fee
- Even at $25 CAC: payback in <2 days if creator is active
```

---

## RISK REGISTER

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| KOL posts underperform (bots, low engagement) | Medium | Vet engagement rate pre-contract; stagger posts; kill bad KOLs Week 2 |
| Bounty exploited (low-quality skill spam) | Medium | Manual review by dev team before reward payout; require 100+ downloads not just publish |
| OpenClaw community hostile (sees ClawFriend as competitor to ClawHub) | Low | Position as monetization layer, not replacement. "ClawHub = discover. ClawFriend = monetize." |
| BSC reputation risk (perceived as scam chain by ETH maxis) | Medium | Content strategy: lead with technical depth, not price. Target BSC-native audience first. |
| Empty marketplace kills first-time visitors | High | Bounty program MUST launch Week 1. Aim for 10 skills live BEFORE any paid promotion. |
