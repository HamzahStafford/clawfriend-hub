# DATA SOURCES & VERIFIED RESEARCH
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-24
> **Purpose:** Backup tất cả số liệu trong repo. BGK hỏi "số này lấy ở đâu?" — trỏ vào file này.
> **Rule:** Mỗi số liệu phải có source URL. Nếu không verify được → label `[UNVERIFIED]` và ghi rõ lý do.

> **Key insight:** friend.tech reached 100K users in 11 days with zero disclosed ad spend → growth was viral/social. This is the model ClawFriend should aim for with OpenClaw community seeding.

### OpenClaw / ClawHub Ecosystem

## 3. MARKETING BENCHMARKS

### KOL / Influencer Pricing (Crypto, 2025–2026)
| Tier | Followers | Price per Post | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----|------------|
| Nano | 1K–10K | $50–$500 | IQFluence 2026 | https://iqfluence.io/public/blog/crypto-influencer-marketing | HIGH |
| Micro | 10K–50K | $500–$5,000 | ChainBull 2026, IQFluence 2026 | https://chainbull.net/blog/crypto-marketing-pricing-guide-2026/ | HIGH |
| Mid-tier | 50K–500K | $5,000–$50,000 | TokenMinds 2025 | https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/top-crypto-influencer-marketing-agencies | MEDIUM |
| Top-tier / Macro | 500K+ | $50,000+ | AiCoin 2025 (ref in plan) | — | MEDIUM |
| Telegram/Discord management | Ongoing | $1K–$3K/month | ChainBull 2026 | https://chainbull.net/blog/crypto-marketing-pricing-guide-2026/ | HIGH |

> **Note on plan pricing:** Distribution plan uses $300–400 for 10K–20K followers. This is BELOW market rate ($500–5K). Justification: BSC/DeFi niche accounts, non-English market, no token to offer as upside — smaller deal size is defensible but must be argued explicitly.

### KOL Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| Micro-influencer engagement rate (<50K followers) | 5–20% | Flexe.io | https://flexe.io/blog/kol-in-crypto-key-opinion-leaders-guide/ | HIGH |

| Small KOC (500–5K) vs large KOL conversion | 30% vs 2.5% | MediaX case study | https://mediax.agency/blogs/crypto-influencer-marketing | MEDIUM |
| KOL + additional services vs KOL-only | 40% higher conversion | ChainBull 2026 | https://chainbull.net/blog/crypto-marketing-pricing-guide-2026/ | MEDIUM |

### X (Twitter) Ads Benchmarks
| Metric | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| Platform average CTR | 0.86% | WebFX 2026 | https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/ | HIGH |
| Median CPC | ~$0.18 | Focus Digital 2025 | https://focus-digital.co/social-media-ads-ctr-benchmarks-2025/ | HIGH |
| Average CPA | ~$21.55 | WebFX 2026 | https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/ | HIGH |
| General conversion rate range | 1–3% | WebFX 2026 | https://www.webfx.com/blog/social-media/x-twitter-marketing-benchmarks/ | HIGH |
| Lookalike audience uplift | +24% vs broad targeting | Spiralytics | https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/x-twitter-ads-statistics-you-should-know/ | MEDIUM |
| Crypto targeted campaign (upper case) | Up to 8% | Isolated case study via WebFX | — | LOW — single case |

### Cold Outreach / DM Benchmarks
| Metric | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| X/Twitter cold DM reply rate (general) | 4–8% | Cleverly.co | https://www.cleverly.co/blog/twitter-vs-linkedin-for-cold-outreach-b2b | HIGH |
| X/Twitter personalized DM reply rate | 25–40% (highly targeted) | Growleady | https://www.growleady.io/blog/cold-email-vs-twitter-the-better-outreach-strategy-for-leads | MEDIUM |
| LinkedIn cold DM reply rate | 12–18% | Cleverly.co | https://www.cleverly.co/blog/twitter-vs-linkedin-for-cold-outreach-b2b | HIGH |
| GitHub outreach conversion | **[NO DATA FOUND]** | No published benchmark | — | N/A |
| Warm DM (to known contributors) estimated reply | 15–25% | Argued estimate: 2–3x cold baseline | No direct source — argued | LOW — internal estimate |

## 4. SUPPLY-SIDE BOOTSTRAP REFERENCES

| Reference | Data | Source | URL | Confidence |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Gitcoin grants cost per contributor | ~$50–$150 | Gitcoin ecosystem reports | https://gitcoin.co | MEDIUM |
| Uniswap liquidity mining total cost | $65.4M UNI value | Medium / Blockchain Capital | https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/uniswap-liquidity-mining-analysis-8a14be698eb0 | HIGH |
| Uniswap LM outcome | TVL increased during program, fell after, remained above pre-program baseline | Blockchain Capital | https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/uniswap-liquidity-mining-analysis-8a14be698eb0 | HIGH |
| Key lesson from Uniswap LM | Token incentives drive short-term behavior; don't create defensible moat without product stickiness | Blockchain Capital | — | HIGH |
| Immunefi total bug bounty paid | $65M+ (2023) | Immunefi | https://immunefi.com/hackers/ | HIGH |
| Typical bounty CAC for skill marketplace | **[NO STANDARD METRIC]** | No published comparable for skill marketplace bootstrapping | — | N/A |

> **Distribution plan note:** $43.75/skill estimate is an internal derived model. Closest comparable is Gitcoin ~$50–150/contributor. Our estimate is optimistic (lower cost) which requires justification: skills are markdown + instructions, not full code — lower barrier = lower cost defensible.

## 5. FLAGGED / NEEDS UPDATE

Items from earlier versions of distribution plan that need correction:

| Old Claim | Issue | Corrected Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| "BNB monthly active wallets: 1M+" | Outdated — actual is ~60x higher | ~60M MAU (late 2025) | crypto.news |
| "KOL mid-tier pricing: $500–5,000 (Zipmex/CoinBand)" | Zipmex shut down 2023; CoinBand not verifiable | $5K–$50K mid-tier | ChainBull 2026, TokenMinds 2025 |
| "4–6% conversion rate (click → signup)" — no source | Unsourced assumption | 3–5% (argue: X ads floor 1–3%, KOL warm audience = upper range) | WebFX 2026 |
| "2–3% CTR for KOL posts" — no source | Unsourced | Keep range, add footnote: X avg 0.86%; KOL organic ~3x platform avg | WebFX + Flexe.io |
| "80–120 signups from OpenClaw DM" | Overstated — DMs = 2 direct signups; rest is downstream word-of-mouth | Reframe: 10–15 creators onboarded → 5–10 downstream each = 50–150 | Argued model |

## METHODOLOGY

Research process:
1. Used Claude Code for initial benchmark identification
2. Cross-referenced minimum 2 independent sources per key metric
3. Verified URLs manually
4. Flagged all AI-suggested numbers that could not be traced to primary source
5. Labeled confidence: HIGH (primary source, verifiable URL) / MEDIUM (secondary source or modeled) / LOW (single case study or inferred)

**BGK test protocol:** Every number used in deliverables should map to a row in this file. If it doesn't → either add the source here or remove the number from the deliverable.
