# DATA SOURCES & VERIFIED RESEARCH
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-25
> **Purpose:** Backup tất cả số liệu trong repo. BGK hỏi "số này lấy ở đâu?" — trỏ vào file này.
> **Rule:** Mỗi số liệu phải có source URL. Nếu không verify được → label `[UNVERIFIED]` và ghi rõ lý do.
> **v2 changes:** Added competitor data sections (Virtuals live counters, Moltbook, ClawHub, SingularityNET, Build4); added TAM row; fixed BNB DAU — removed artemis.xyz reference (unverified), canonical source is bitcoinethereumnews.com 4.32M peak Jan 2026; removed SingularityNET TVL $50M+ (no verifiable source found); flagged Build4 homepage metrics as unverified.

## 1. PLATFORM & ECOSYSTEM DATA

| Data Point | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| BNB Chain monthly active users | ~60M MAU (late 2025) | crypto.news | https://crypto.news/bnb-chain-hits-record-monthly-users/ | HIGH |
| BNB Chain daily active users | 4.32M DAU (peak Jan 2026) | bitcoinethereumnews.com | https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/2026-will-be-awesome-how-bnb-leads-with-4-32m-daily-users/ | HIGH |
| BNB Chain daily active users (week Jan 22–28, 2026) | 2.59M DAU | bitcoinethereumnews.com | https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/bnb-holders-hit-279-million-as-on-chain-activity-surges-2026-outlook/ | HIGH |
| BNB Chain all-time daily transactions | 31M tx (Oct 5, 2025 ATH) | bitcoinethereumnews.com | https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/bnb-chain-hits-record-monthly-users/ | HIGH |
| BNB Holders total | 279M+ (2026) | bitcoinethereumnews.com | https://bitcoinethereumnews.com/tech/bnb-holders-hit-279-million-as-on-chain-activity-surges-2026-outlook/ | HIGH |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Distribution plan v1 dùng "1M+ monthly active wallets (BNBChain official Q3 2025)" — số này đã outdated và thấp hơn thực tế ~60x. Actual figure là ~60M MAU. Updated trong distribution-plan v2.

## 2. WEB TRAFFIC DATA (SimilarWeb, Feb 2026)

> **Source method:** SimilarWeb monthly visit estimates. Dùng để so sánh tương đối giữa các competitors, không dùng làm số liệu tuyệt đối. SimilarWeb estimates có margin of error ~15–20% với sites nhỏ.

| Platform | Traffic (Monthly Visits) | Source | Confidence | Note |
|----------|--------------------------|--------|------------|------|
| Moltbook (moltbook.com) | 4.8M | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | MEDIUM | Highest traffic in competitive set; viral social flywheel |
| SkillsMP (skillsmp.com) | 1.2M | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | MEDIUM | Level 1 — skill marketplace Web2 |
| Lobehub (lobehub.com) | 689.7K | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | MEDIUM | Level 2 — agent social/tools registry Web2 |
| Virtuals Protocol (virtuals.io) | 123.7K | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | MEDIUM | Level 4 — highest traffic trong Web3 tier |
| Clawk.ai (clawk.ai) | 22 | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | LOW — số quá nhỏ, SimilarWeb không accurate dưới 1K | Effectively 0 real traffic |
| NEAR AI Market (market.near.ai) | 0 | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | N/A | Loại khỏi competitor list |
| SelfClaw (selfclaw.ai) | 0 | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | N/A | Loại khỏi competitor list |
| Build4 (build4.io) | 0 | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | N/A | Loại khỏi competitor list |
| ClawGig (clawgig.ai) | 0 | SimilarWeb, Feb 2026 | N/A | Loại khỏi competitor list |

> **Traffic Paradox (key insight):** Level 1–2 platforms (Web2, less overlap) có traffic cao nhất. Level 4–5 platforms (Web3, more overlap with ClawFriend) gần như 0 traffic. Moltbook là anomaly duy nhất ở Level 2 vì social virality, không phải product depth. Xem phân tích đầy đủ trong competitive-landscape.md.

## 3. COMPETITOR DATA

### Virtuals Protocol
> **Note on data:** Two sets of numbers exist. (A) Snapshot sources (Tiger Research Jul 2025, Messari Sep 2025) — verified by independent analysts. (B) Live counters from virtuals.io — higher numbers, read Feb 25 2026. Competitive landscape uses live (B) with explicit timestamp. Both sets kept here for traceability.

| Data Point | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| Agents registered | 2,845,239 | moltbook.com homepage counter | https://moltbook.com | MEDIUM — live counter, read Feb 25 2026, not independently cross-checked |

> ⚠️ **CONFLICT RESOLVED:** competitive-landscape v1/v2 used "135K GitHub stars" — corrected to 145K per OpenTweet blog reference in sources.md. All files now use 145K.

### SingularityNET
| Data Point | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| AGIX market cap (Feb 25 2026) | $349.75M | CoinMarketCap | https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/singularitynet | HIGH |

### Build4
| Data Point | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------------|-------|--------|-----|------------|

| Skills created | 12,391 | build4.io homepage counter | https://build4.io | LOW — same caveat |
| Agent spawns | 6,204 | build4.io homepage counter | https://build4.io | LOW — same caveat |

> ⚠️ **FLAG:** Build4 metrics are homepage counters on a project with near-zero social presence. Numbers are used in competitive landscape as indicative (labelled "not cross-referenced"). Do not cite as hard data in presentation.

## 3. MARKETING BENCHMARKS

### KOL / Influencer Pricing (Crypto, 2025–2026)
| Tier | Followers | Price per Post | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------|-----------|---------------|--------|-----|------------|
| Nano | 1K–10K | $50–$500 | IQFluence 2026 | https://iqfluence.io/public/blog/crypto-influencer-marketing | HIGH |
| Micro | 10K–50K | $500–$5,000 | ChainBull 2026, IQFluence 2026 | https://chainbull.net/blog/crypto-marketing-pricing-guide-2026/ | HIGH |
| Mid-tier | 50K–500K | $5,000–$50,000 | TokenMinds 2025 | https://tokenminds.co/blog/knowledge-base/top-crypto-influencer-marketing-agencies | MEDIUM |
| Top-tier / Macro | 500K+ | $50,000+ | AiCoin 2025 (ref in plan) | — | MEDIUM |
| Telegram/Discord management | Ongoing | $1K–$3K/month | ChainBull 2026 | https://chainbull.net/blog/crypto-marketing-pricing-guide-2026/ | HIGH |

> **Note on plan pricing:** Distribution plan uses $300–400 for 10K–20K followers. This is BELOW market rate ($500–5K). Justification: BSC/DeFi niche accounts, non-English market, no token to offer as upside — smaller deal size is defensible but must be argued explicitly.

### KOL Performance Benchmarks
| Metric | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| Micro-influencer engagement rate (<50K followers) | 5–20% | Flexe.io | https://flexe.io/blog/kol-in-crypto-key-opinion-leaders-guide/ | HIGH |

| GitHub outreach conversion | **[NO DATA FOUND]** | No published benchmark | — | N/A |
| Warm DM (to known contributors) estimated reply | 15–25% | Argued estimate: 2–3x cold baseline | No direct source — argued | LOW — internal estimate |

## 4. SUPPLY-SIDE BOOTSTRAP REFERENCES

### Bonding Curve & Viral Growth Precedents
> friend.tech là historical case study — không phải đối thủ, không còn active. Dùng làm benchmark cho bonding curve viral mechanics và pattern collapse khi thiếu utility layer.

| Data Point | Value | Source | URL | Confidence |
|------------|-------|--------|-----|------------|
| Users in first 11 days | 100,000+ | CoinDesk, Aug 2023 | https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/21/friendtech-gains-100k-users-quickly-in-depths-of-a-bear-market | HIGH |
| Users by September 2023 | 300,000+ active | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | HIGH |
| Trading volume in first 24h | $8.1M | CoinDesk | https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/21/friendtech-gains-100k-users-quickly-in-depths-of-a-bear-market | HIGH |
| Revenue in first month | $2M+ | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | HIGH |
| Net deposits first 2 weeks | $33M | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | HIGH |
| Day-1 retention | 70% returned next day | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | MEDIUM |
| Day-7 retention | 50% returned | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | MEDIUM |
| CAC | **[NOT PUBLISHED]** | No public disclosure | — | N/A |
| Pattern collapse | Peak tháng 9/2023 → near-zero trong 60 ngày | ICODA | https://icoda.io/blog/friend-tech-the-story-of-rapid-growth-and-decline/ | HIGH |

> **Key lesson:** friend.tech tăng 100K users trong 11 ngày với zero disclosed ad spend — bonding curve FOMO tạo viral tự nhiên. Nhưng collapse sau 60 ngày vì không có utility layer (bricks). Đây là proof cho cả hai luận điểm: glue alone không đủ; nhưng khi combine với bricks, viral cơ học bonding curve là cực mạnh.

### Other Bootstrap Benchmarks
| Reference | Data | Source | URL | Confidence |
|-----------|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Gitcoin grants cost per contributor | ~$50–$150 | Gitcoin ecosystem reports | https://gitcoin.co | MEDIUM |
| Uniswap liquidity mining total cost | $65.4M UNI value | Medium / Blockchain Capital | https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/uniswap-liquidity-mining-analysis-8a14be698eb0 | HIGH |
| Uniswap LM outcome | TVL increased during program, fell after, remained above pre-program baseline | Blockchain Capital | https://medium.com/blockchain-capital-blog/uniswap-liquidity-mining-analysis-8a14be698eb0 | HIGH |
| Key lesson from Uniswap LM | Token incentives drive short-term behavior; don't create defensible moat without product stickiness | Blockchain Capital | — | HIGH |
| Immunefi total bug bounty paid | $65M+ (2023) | Immunefi | https://immunefi.com/hackers/ | HIGH |
| Typical bounty CAC for skill marketplace | **[NO STANDARD METRIC]** | No published comparable for skill marketplace bootstrapping | — | N/A |

> **Distribution plan note:** $43.75/skill estimate is an internal derived model. Closest comparable is Gitcoin ~$50–150/contributor. Our estimate is optimistic (lower cost) which requires justification: skills are markdown + instructions, not full code — lower barrier = lower cost defensible.

> ⚠️ **MarketsandMarkets note:** This is a paid research report. URL will load a paywall. Used in competitive-landscape as supporting context only. If judges push on verification, note: "paid report, figures consistent with Virtuals Protocol's $4.6B peak market cap and $13.58B monthly volume as live validation of TAM scale."
> ⚠️ **PANewsLab $90B–$170B:** Low confidence, range too wide to be actionable. Included for completeness. Do not lead with this number in presentation.

## METHODOLOGY

Research process:
1. Used Claude Code for initial benchmark identification
2. Cross-referenced minimum 2 independent sources per key metric
3. Verified URLs manually
4. Flagged all AI-suggested numbers that could not be traced to primary source
5. Labeled confidence: HIGH (primary source, verifiable URL) / MEDIUM (secondary source or modeled) / LOW (single case study or inferred)

**BGK test protocol:** Every number used in deliverables should map to a row in this file. If it doesn't → either add the source here or remove the number from the deliverable.
